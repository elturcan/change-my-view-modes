<claim> The options are as follows: </claim>

<claim> 1. You don't agree with what is going on and stop supporting it. </claim>

<claim> 2. You don't care about animals, so you're content with paying for them to be abused for your pleasure. </claim>

<claim> 3. You don't agree with what is going on, but try to put it to the back of your mind and continue to support it. </claim>


Reasoning: <premise> I used to follow 'option number 3' </premise> , but <premise> recently started 'option number 1' in an attempt to line my actions up with my values. </premise> <claim> I suspect this way of looking at it is still somewhat simplistic however </claim>, so feel free to prove me wrong.

<premise> Stop supporting it how? </premise> <premise> As in never buying meat again </premise> , <premise> even as you know that doing so will not have any impact on the meat industry whatsoever </premise> , and <premise> won't make even an ounce of difference in the lives of animals? </premise> <premise> What's the point? </premise> <claim> If I stop eating meat today, it won't make any difference whatsoever and won't save even a single animal's life. </claim>

<claim> The only way to make real change in industries like this is to organize and participate in a boycott on a wide-scale level </claim> , and/or <claim> to petition the government to make regulation changes. </claim>

<premise> I wouldn't buy ivory, dog leather or fur for the same reasons </premise> - <premise> I find meat disgusting based on what I've seen and want no part of endorsing it whether it makes any difference overall or not. </premise>
