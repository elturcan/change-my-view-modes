<title>CMV: I believe you have three choices once you discover the suffering animals endure in the meat industry...</title>

<claim> The options are as follows: </claim>

<claim> 1. You don't agree with what is going on and stop supporting it. </claim>

<claim> 2. You don't care about animals, so you're content with paying for them to be abused for your pleasure. </claim>

<claim> 3. You don't agree with what is going on, but try to put it to the back of your mind and continue to support it. </claim>


Reasoning: <premise> I used to follow 'option number 3' </premise> , but <premise> recently started 'option number 1' in an attempt to line my actions up with my values. </premise> <claim> I suspect this way of looking at it is still somewhat simplistic however </claim>, so feel free to prove me wrong.

<claim> What about Option 4: You hate animals and you want to see them killed. </claim>

<claim> Shall we rule out sociopathy/psychopathy? </claim>

Hmm maybe if it makes it easier for you. <claim> Although I can imagine someone that has empathy for humans but none for other animals. </claim>

<claim> Good point </claim>, although <claim> I regard that as speciesism. </claim>

<premise> I do have a Christian friend who is extremely charitable. </premise> <premise> She's a carer, a foster mother and a complete romantic who writes novels about angels. </premise> <premise> She 's obviously an all-round good and kind person, but she eats meat. </premise>

<premise> I rationalise this by realising that helping people is her passion </premise>, and <claim> perhaps her religion justifies a moral distinction between humans and non-human animals. </claim> <premise> Doesn't the Bible claim something along the lines of that animals were created for the enjoyment of humans (I haven't read it myself)? </premise>

<claim> I think it's fairly normal to be a speciesist. </claim> <claim> I want to make note that I'm not trying to argue from a point of naturalism in regards to what ought to be done </claim> , but that <claim> it shouldn't be that surprising when we encounter people that are that way. </claim>

<premise> I mean hell, it's hard enough for many people to empathize with *each other*, and you're asking them to try to put themselves in the hooves of a cow? </premise> <premise> It's just beyond the scope for many people unless they seriously put the time in to think about it </premise> , and <premise> they've got their own lives to worry about. </premise>

<premise> To address your last question, yes, the bible states that all animals were put on earth by God to serve man. </premise> <premise> There were rules against eating certain kinds, but overall the idea was that humans have dominion over all. </premise> <claim> In which case, there is no cognitive dissonance </claim> , but <claim> this would probably fall under your 2nd line of reasoning. </claim>

<claim> Yes, speciesism is indeed the norm </claim> and I appreciate you taking the time to comment. I asked this question so as to keep myself grounded in what other justifications my loved ones around me didn't have the same epiphany I did (as it may not necessary be the same reasons I had for not going vegan sooner).

A very good reminder, thank you. <premise> Not everyone is as obsessed with philosophy, psychology and nature as I am, just as I don't concern myself with keeping extremely up to date on world politics and Amnesty International petitions. </premise>

<claim> I'd still class it as option 3 though :P </claim>
