<premise> There seems to be a commonly held belief that people who cheat on their SO/partner should be dropped immediately with no further contact. </premise> <claim> I understand that physical/sexual conduct with another person can seem like a betrayal </claim>, but <premise> in some cases, there are many worse things that can happen in a relationship, which couples seem to be able to work through. </premise>

<claim> There are a few assumptions underlying the belief that "sex with another person = relationship over" that I don't think hold up. </claim>

 * <premise> **Sex is the most important part of a relationship,** and therefore, betraying it and that agreement mean the relationship should end. </premise> <claim> My belief: sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not *the* most important part. </claim> Immediately breaking up with someone because of something like this seems excessive.

 * <premise>  **Nobody makes mistakes ever,** so when they do, the relationship should end. </premise> <claim> My belief: obviously this isn't true, and a cornerstone of strong relationships is the ability to work through mistakes/issues together. </claim>

 * <premise> **Cheaters will always cheat again,** so better to end it now. </premise> <claim> my view: That may be true in some cases </claim>, but <premise> other than anecdotal evidence, I haven't seen anything to support this claim. </premise> [But would be really interested in reading anything scientific about this, actually!]

 * <premise> **Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship.** </premise> <claim> My belief: if that's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem </claim>, <premise> such as ... talking about the problem. </premise> <premise> Maybe fixing that issue will resolve the motivation to cheat. </premise>

<claim> Caveat: sometimes, cheating happens because there are parts of the relationship that are fundamentally broken and/or the relationship is too far gone/unsalvageable and/or this is the straw the broke the camel's back etc. </claim>

<claim> Cheating shouldn't always signify an immediate end to a relationship. </claim> <claim> In some cases, couples can and should choose to work through it. </claim> CMV!

<claim> I don't think this depends as much on the cheater as the person he/she cheated on. </claim> <premise> Some people are unable to stay with an unfaithful partner and should not be pressured into continuing a relationship after that point. </premise> <premise> Forgiveness depends on the forgiver, not the perpetrator. </premise>

<claim> Nobody "should" be forgiven for cheating </claim> , and I'm comfortable saying that anyone who knowingly betrays the trust of a relationship would deserve losing that relationship. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's expected to break up with the cheater, because some people are willing to be forgiving. But I can't envision a situation where cheating "should" be forgiven. Forgiveness is a gift, not an expectation.

This makes the most sense to me - very coherent argument. Thanks!
