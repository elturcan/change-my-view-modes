<premise> There seems to be a commonly held belief that people who cheat on their SO/partner should be dropped immediately with no further contact. </premise> <claim> I understand that physical/sexual conduct with another person can seem like a betrayal </claim>, but <premise> in some cases, there are many worse things that can happen in a relationship, which couples seem to be able to work through. </premise>

<claim> There are a few assumptions underlying the belief that "sex with another person = relationship over" that I don't think hold up. </claim>

 * <premise> **Sex is the most important part of a relationship,** and therefore, betraying it and that agreement mean the relationship should end. </premise> <claim> My belief: sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not *the* most important part. </claim> Immediately breaking up with someone because of something like this seems excessive.

 * <premise>  **Nobody makes mistakes ever,** so when they do, the relationship should end. </premise> <claim> My belief: obviously this isn't true, and a cornerstone of strong relationships is the ability to work through mistakes/issues together. </claim>

 * <premise> **Cheaters will always cheat again,** so better to end it now. </premise> <claim> my view: That may be true in some cases </claim>, but <premise> other than anecdotal evidence, I haven't seen anything to support this claim. </premise> [But would be really interested in reading anything scientific about this, actually!]

 * <premise> **Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship.** </premise> <claim> My belief: if that's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem </claim>, <premise> such as ... talking about the problem. </premise> <premise> Maybe fixing that issue will resolve the motivation to cheat. </premise>

<claim> Caveat: sometimes, cheating happens because there are parts of the relationship that are fundamentally broken and/or the relationship is too far gone/unsalvageable and/or this is the straw the broke the camel's back etc. </claim>

<claim> Cheating shouldn't always signify an immediate end to a relationship. </claim> <claim> In some cases, couples can and should choose to work through it. </claim> CMV!

<premise> I'l begin by saying it has never happened to me </premise>, and <claim> you make some good points. </claim> But I'm addicted to CMV, so here we go.  

&gt;sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not the most important part. 

So it is one of the most important parts. <claim> To break it would be to break one of the most important parts of a marriage. </claim> I'll continue.

*edit: <premise> even if you value it not at all, cheating breaks other important parts of the relationship. <premise> <premise> Like trust. </premise> <premise> Loyalty. </premise> <premise> Companionship. </premise>

&gt;Nobody makes mistakes ever, so when they do, the relationship should end. 

<claim> You are correct that this is false. </claim> <premise> However, cheating on a spouse is  *pretty big mistake*. </premise> <claim> Cheating, as I define it, is a choice. </claim> <premise> A bad choice which breaks one of the cornerstones of marriage. </premise>

&gt;Cheaters will always cheat again

<claim> You are correct that this is false. </claim> <claim> However, I would say that *cheaters are more likely to cheat again*. </claim> <premise> The circumstances that resulted in cheating the first time may repeat. </premise>

&gt;Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship. My belief: if that's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem, such as ... talking about the problem. 

<claim> Yes. </claim> <claim> But "talking about the problem" is an ideal situation. </claim> <premise> It often doesn't work out so well that way. </premise> <premise> People get stuck in a pattern... living in the same house, married to the same person you stopped really caring about. </premise> <premise> Cheating is evidence that *something* must be wrong. </premise>

So, so far we can say cheating

* <claim> is a bad choice which breaks one of the cornerstones of a relationship </claim>

* <claim> is an indication that such a thing will happen again </claim>

* <claim> is an indication that there is a problem with the relationship </claim>

<premise> Are there no situations in which the cheaters should be forgiven? </premise> <claim> I'm trying to argue that if you find your spouse cheating, breaking up with them is the most logical thing to do, whatever the circumstances. </claim>

<premise> I point out, cheating has a profound negative emotional effect of the person cheated on. </premise> You have every reason to break up. 

<claim> In my mind, marriage is a commitment. </claim> <claim> If you break that commitment, the marriage is broken. </claim> <premise> One partner isn't fulfilling all of his/her obligations (i.e. not to cheat) </premise> <premise> So why should the other person be obligated to fill out his/hers? </premise> <premise> Why should you stay married? </premise>

<claim> It is entirely up to the person making the decision as to what they may do. </claim> <premise> It's an ethical question </premise> , and <premise> everyone has their different values </premise> , so <claim> it's impossible to prove definitively what you should/should not do. </claim> <claim> It's just a logical conclusion that breaking up is the right choice in most if not all situations. </claim> <premise> It's a choice. </premise>

<premise> But if you don't break up, you are stuck with a person who doesn't value you enough to stay loyal. </premise> <premise> Why would you forfeit yourself to such a relationship? </premise>

<premise> Things need change. </premise> <premise> And the cheater is the source of the problem. </premise> <claim> Change the cheater by breaking up with him/her. </claim>

&gt; marriage is a commitment. If you break that commitment, the marriage is broken. 

This is the best argument I've heard so far. Thanks!
